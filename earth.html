        <div><h3>our planet earth</h3>
        <p>Earth is a planet that formed around 4
            .6 billion years ago from a cloud of 
            gas and dust. It is the only planet kn
            own to support life. Earth is spherical 
            in shape but slightly oblate, meaning
             it bulges at the equator. It rotates 
             on its axis once every 24 hours and 
             revolves around the sun once every
              365 days. Earth has four major interior
               layers - crust, mantle, outer core, and 
               inner core. NASA studies Earth using
                satellites to monitor changes to its 
                land, oceans, atmosphere, and climate in order to better unde
            rstand and predict environmental changes. </p>

        <div><h3>shape of the earth</h3>
        <p>From space, Earth looks like a blue marble 
            with white swirls and areas of brown,
             yellow, green and white. The blue is
              water, which covers about 71 percent 
              of Earthâ€™s surface.
               The white swirls are clouds.
                The areas of brown, yellow and 
                green are land. And 
            the areas of white are ice and snow.</p>
            <p>The equator is an imaginary 
            circle that divides Earth into 
            two halves. The northern half 
            is called the Northern Hemisphere. 
            The southern half is called the
             Southern Hemisphere. The northernmost 
             point on Earth is called the North Pole.
              The southernmost point on Earth is called 
              the South Pole.</p>
